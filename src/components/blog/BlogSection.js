    <p class="mb-4">
      What an incredible experience returning from the <strong>VW Group Global IT I/O Conference in Berlin</strong> üá©üá™! Our CUPRA Vision Pro project was <strong>selected among the top IT projects at VW Group</strong>, earning us another opportunity to showcase our innovation‚Äîthis time on the main stage in Berlin, where VW IT professionals from around the world gather to connect, exchange ideas, and witness groundbreaking solutions.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      The Global IT I/O conference brought together the <strong>brightest minds from across the Volkswagen Group ecosystem</strong>. We had the privilege of presenting our CUPRA Vision Pro App solution to colleagues from Lamborghini, VW, and many other brands within the group. Having the main stage once again to showcase our spatial computing innovation was both an honor and so much fun!
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      What made this experience particularly valuable:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Recognition as a top IT project</strong> within the entire VW Group portfolio</li>
      <li>Presenting to <strong>large audiences and management</strong>‚Äîan excellent exercise in delivering the right message to diverse stakeholders</li>
      <li>Showcasing our <strong>first-in-automotive Apple Vision Pro solution</strong> to colleagues across all group brands</li>
      <li>Connecting with VW IT professionals from <strong>Japan to India, Brazil to Mexico</strong>‚Äîgaining fascinating perspectives on how different markets are evolving</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      As a technical person, these presentations offer invaluable opportunities to develop communication skills with large audiences and executive leadership. But what truly enriched this experience was the chance to exchange ideas with people from so many different countries and cultural backgrounds‚Äîeach bringing unique insights into their local markets and technological adoption patterns.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Moreover, it's still so rewarding to see the <strong>very positive reactions of people to an app I envisioned as a simple idea almost 2 years ago</strong>. Watching colleagues from different brands and countries truly have fun with the experience‚Äîseeing their faces light up as they interact with our spatial computing solution‚Äîreminds me why we do what we do. From concept to reality, it's incredible to witness how a vision can evolve into something that genuinely delights and engages people.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      The international diversity of perspectives at Global IT I/O reinforced how our spatial computing approach resonates across different markets and cultures. It's fascinating to see how innovation transcends geographical boundaries while adapting to local market needs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Being recognized among the top IT projects at VW Group and having the platform to share our vision with this incredible global community is just the beginning. Let's keep pushing boundaries and shaping the future of automotive through spatial experiences! üöÄ

      title: "Visiting China in 2025: Tech, Trains, and Perspectives",
      date: "28.07.2025",
      excerpt: "In 2025, I had the chance to visit Shanghai, Chongqing, and Beijing. Beyond the stereotypes I had grown up with, I encountered cutting-edge infrastructure, remarkable safety, and a deeply hospitable culture. Here‚Äôs what I observed.",
      content: `
        <p class="mb-4">
          Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit China‚Äîspecifically Shanghai, Chongqing, and Beijing. Having grown up with a Western perspective, China often felt like a distant powerhouse known mostly for mass manufacturing and low-cost labor. During my high school years (2010‚Äì2015) in Spain, the narrative was often about "cheap products" or copied technologies. Between 2015 and 2020 during my bachelor's, China faded from my radar.
        </p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">
          But everything changed during my master‚Äôs at <strong>TU Munich</strong>, where I specialized in <strong>Computer Vision and Deep Learning</strong> (what most now refer to as "AI"). I began to notice how many top academic papers were authored by Chinese researchers‚Äîeither from universities in China or at major US companies. When I showed up for my Machine Learning exam, nearly 30% of the room seemed to be Asian, many probably Chinese. It left a mark on me: this country was clearly shaping the future of AI.
        </p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">
          So, in 2025, I went to China with open eyes. What did I find?
        </p>
    
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Yes, there are cameras everywhere.</strong> Surveillance is omnipresent, especially in cities. But I have to say, I felt incredibly safe‚Äîeven walking at night along the Bund in Shanghai. That‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd feel in many European cities today, including Berlin, where I lived for five years.</li>
          <li><strong>The people were warm and helpful.</strong> Even with the language barrier, locals often used translation apps to assist us. At a hotpot restaurant in Chongqing, the staff patiently guided us on how to eat, what to order, and how to mix sauces. It felt surprisingly personal and welcoming.</li>
          <li><strong>China‚Äôs train infrastructure is truly world-class.</strong> We traveled from Chongqing to Beijing via high-speed rail in around 7 hours, averaging 350 km/h. It was clean, efficient, and more comfortable than flying. If I could go from Munich to Madrid in that same way, I‚Äôd never fly that route again.</li>
          <li><strong>Electric vehicles (EVs) are everywhere.</strong> I knew of BYD from my travels in Southeast Asia, but what shocked me was the sheer number of Chinese EV brands I had never heard of. Sleek designs, modern dashboards, connected ecosystems‚Äîit‚Äôs clear China is not just catching up; it's leading.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p class="mb-4">
          Of course, there are still valid concerns about how AI and surveillance can be used beyond safety. It's easy to imagine how a facial recognition system could be asked, ‚ÄúWhere was person X on day Y at hour Z?‚Äù The power‚Äîand risk‚Äîof such technology is enormous.
        </p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">
          But as a visitor, I came away with a more nuanced view. The stereotypes didn‚Äôt hold. I encountered a country that is fast-moving, technologically ambitious, and‚Äîdespite the barriers‚Äîsurprisingly warm.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Would I go back? Absolutely. And next time, I‚Äôll explore even further.

        <p class="mb-4">
          This past week marked a significant milestone for our team as I had the privilege of presenting the CUPRA Vision Pro application at the Volkswagen IT Symposium 2025. Standing before the <strong>VW Group Board and many executives</strong>, I shared our journey from concept to App Store launch, highlighting how we've pioneered <strong>spatial computing in the automotive industry</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
          Our presentation focused on three key aspects:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>The <strong>innovative customer experience</strong> we've created using Apple Vision Pro's unique spatial capabilities</li>
          <li>The technical challenges of bringing <strong>high-fidelity 3D car models</strong> into a mixed reality environment</li>
          <li>The <strong>measurable business impact</strong>‚Äîfrom cost savings to increased customer engagement metrics</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
          What made this presentation particularly rewarding was the <strong>enthusiastic response from the board members</strong>. Many of them tried the experience firsthand after the presentation, with several highlighting the potential for <strong>expanding this technology across other brands</strong> within the Volkswagen Group.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
          This validation from leadership reinforces what our team has believed from day one: <strong>spatial computing represents the next frontier</strong> for automotive visualization and customer engagement. As the <strong>first automotive brand with a native visionOS app</strong> on the App Store, we've established CUPRA as a technology leader in this space.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm incredibly grateful to everyone who contributed to this project, from our development team to our partners at Audi Business Innovation and Apple. This milestone is just the beginning of what promises to be an <strong>exciting new chapter in automotive retail experiences</strong>.
